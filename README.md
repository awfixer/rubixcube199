### I am the Official Owner of the Security LLC Discord [Server](https://discord.gg/securityllc)
1) This is a Server That is Aiming to help Bridge the Gap that Exists when you are migrating your Data, this is a Very Broad Subject so Let me Add Some Details to it Below:
    - This Could be Migrating From a OS like Windows or Mac to Linux
    - This Could be Migrating From an OS like IOS or Android to GrapheneOS or LineageOS
    - This Could Be those Burning Questions that you have about what GNU/Linux Variant is best for Hosting a Minecraft Server
    - This could be for that Question that you have regaurding if a VPN is right for you, if so, which VPN do you use, and why? maybe you need TOR, does my browser Fingerprint me? why does 4chan Exist? How do I safely use Hells Forum?
    - AND MANY MANY MORE
2) There are also many opportunities here for helping others, should you feel driven, or have a need to do that, for College or whatever reason, if you are a good helper, we do offer ***PAID*** Positions within the server as well.
3) The Support that we offer here is both free and Paid, depending on what you need done we can help you in both ways
4) We also offer a website building and management service, if you would like that you can join the server and Request More details.
